# <b>🍄 RacerMario </b> 

- A dice board game themed after the ever popular Mario series. 🎲
- Race with a local player in a 1v1 multiplayer battle as Mario and Luigi. 🏁
- Take the shortcut tunnels and avoid stepping on clouds for too long.
    - Tunnels teleport you to the upper level tunnels of the same color. 🕳️ <br> 
    Don't worry! They don't work the other way around.
    - You can walk over a cloud but can't stand on a cloud as your destination. ☁️ <br> 
    If you stand on a cloud, you will fall.
