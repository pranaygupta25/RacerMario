- A dice board game themed after the ever popular Mario series.

    - Tunnels teleport you to the upper level tunnels of the same color. <br> 
    Don't worry! They don't work the other way around.
    - You can walk over a cloud but can't stand on a cloud as your destination. <br> 
    If you stand on a cloud, you will fall.
